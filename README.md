# Michera-Beauty
Site created for my friend with html5up :)
My first bigger project, I am still working on it but I am pretty satisfied with the results!
This time I have tried to play a little with java script and it works! :)
The construction of this site is caused by some formal requirements of my client ( main page that leads us to two subcategories in which you navigate separately).
You can find here:
-drop down menu
-page scrolling
-gallery with a popup and inner scrolling, adjustable to media screens ( I had to work a little bit on this as I have changed the number of collumns in galleries etc, but I hope it is clear)
